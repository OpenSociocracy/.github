# OpenSociocracy

A pragmatic approach to sociocracy.


## The Project

We are a small group of developers creating sociocratic tools, using socicratic methods. All of our tools are free and open source or `CC BY-SA`.

There are two parts to the project, a static handbook, and a web app. The hanbook provides quick starts to get up and running with sociocracy, while the app will provide an online aid in nanaging your sociocratic efforts.
